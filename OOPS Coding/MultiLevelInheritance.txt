C++ Multilevel Inheritance
Multilevel Inheritance
A class can also be derived from one class, which is already derived from another class.

In the following example, MyGrandChild is derived from class MyChild (which is derived from MyClass).

Example
// Base class (parent)
class MyClass {
  public:
    void myFunction() {
      cout << "Some content in parent class." ;
    }
};

// Derived class (child)
class MyChild: public MyClass {
    void myFunction() {
      cout << "Already Write in Parent Then Again Write" ;
    }
};

// Derived class (grandchild)
class MyGrandChild: public MyChild {
};

int main() {
  MyGrandChild myObj;
  myObj.myFunction();
  return 0;
}
